copy-webpack-plugin\n```\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Usage</h2>\n\n`new CopyWebpackPlugin([patterns], options)`\n\nA pattern looks like:\n`{ from: 'source', to: 'dest' }`\n\nOr, in the simple case of just a `from` with the default destination, you can use a string primitive instead of an object:\n`'source'`\n\n#### Pattern properties:\n\n| Name | Required | Default     | Details                                                 |\n|------|----------|------------ |---------------------------------------------------------|\n| `from` | Y |  | _examples:_<br>'relative/file.txt'<br>'/absolute/file.txt'<br>'relative/dir'<br>'/absolute/dir'<br>'\\*\\*/\\*'<br>{glob:'\\*\\*/\\*', dot: true}<br><br>Globs accept [minimatch options](https://github.com/isaacs/minimatch) |\n| `fromArgs` | N | `{ cwd: context }` | See the [`node-glob` options](https://github.com/isaacs/node-glob#options) in addition to the ones below. |\n| `to`   | N | output root if `from` is file or dir<br><br>resolved glob path if `from` is glob | _examples:_<br>'relative/file.txt'<br>'/absolute/file.txt'<br>'relative/dir'<br>'/absolute/dir'<br>'relative/[name].[ext]'<br>'/absolute/[name].[ext]'<br><br>Templates are [file-loader patterns](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader) |\n| `toType` | N | **'file'** if `to` has extension or `from` is file<br><br>**'dir'** if `from` is directory, `to` has no extension or ends in '/'<br><br>**'template'** if `to` contains [a template pattern](https://github.com/webpack/file-loader) | |\n| `context` | N | options.context \\|\\| compiler.options.context | A path that determines how to interpret the `from` path |\n| `flatten` | N | false | Removes all directory references and only copies file names<br><br>If files have the same name, the result is non-deterministic |\n| `ignore` | N | [] | Additional globs to ignore for this pattern |\n| `transform` | N | function(content, path) {<br>&nbsp;&nbsp;return content;<br>} | Function that modifies file contents before writing to webpack |\n| `force` | N | false | Overwrites files already in compilation.assets (usually added by other plugins) |\n| `cache` | N | false | Enable `transform` caching. You can use `{ cache: { key: 'my-cache-key'} }` to invalidate cache. |\n\n#### Available options:\n\n| Name | Default | Details |\n| ---- | ------- | ------- |\n| `context` | compiler.options.context | A path that determines how to interpret the `from` path, shared for all patterns |\n| `ignore` | [] | Array of globs to ignore (applied to `from`) |\n| `copyUnmodified` | false | Copies files, regardless of modification when using watch or webpack-dev-server. All files are copied on first build, regardless of this option. |\n| `debug` | **'warning'** | _options:_<br>**'warning'** - only warnings<br>**'info'** or true - file location and read info<br>**'debug'** - very detailed debugging info\n\n### Examples\n\n```javascript\nconst CopyWebpackPlugin = require('copy-webpack-plugin');\nconst path = require('path');\n\nmodule.exports = {\n    context: path.join(__dirname, 'app'),\n    devServer: {\n        // This is required for older versions of webpack-dev-server\n        // if you use absolute 'to' paths.

It’ll watch your source files for changes and when changes are made the bundle will be recompiled. **This modified bundle is served from memory at the relative path specified in publicPath (see API)**. It will not be written to your configured output directory.\n\nIf you must have webpack-dev-server write to your output directory, you can force it with the [write-file-webpack-plugin](https://github.com/gajus/write-file-webpack-plugin).\n\n<h2 align=\"center\">Maintainers</h2>\n\n<table>\n  <tbody>\n    <tr>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/bebraw\">\n          <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/bebraw.png?v=3&s=150\">\n          </br>\n          Juho Vepsäläinen\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/d3viant0ne\">\n          <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/d3viant0ne.png?v=3&s=150\">\n          </br>\n          Joshua Wiens\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/michael-ciniawsky\">\n          <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/michael-ciniawsky.png?v=3&s=150\">\n          </br>\n          Michael Ciniawsky\n        </a>\n      </td>\n      <td align=\"center\">\n        <a href=\"https://github.com/evilebottnawi\">\n          <img width=\"150\" height=\"150\" src=\"https://github.com/evilebottnawi.png?v=3&s=150\">\n          </br>\n          Alexander Krasnoyarov\n        </a>\n      </td>\n    </tr>\n  <tbody>\n</table>\n\n\n[npm]: https://img.shields.io/npm/v/copy-webpack-plugin.svg\n[npm-url]: https://npmjs.com/package/copy-webpack-plugin\n\n[node]: https://img.shields.io/node/v/copy-webpack-plugin.svg\n[node-url]: https://nodejs.org\n\n[deps]: https://david-dm.org/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin.svg\n[deps-url]: https://david-dm.org/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin\n\n[test]: https://secure.travis-ci.org/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin.svg\n[test-url]: http://travis-ci.org/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin\n\n[cover]: https://codecov.io/gh/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/branch/master/graph/badge.svg\n[cover-url]: https://codecov.io/gh/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin\n\n[chat]: https://img.shields.io/badge/gitter-webpack%2Fwebpack-brightgreen.svg\n[chat-url]: https://gitter.im/webpack/webpack\n","maintainers":[{"name":"bebraw","email":"bebraw@gmail.com"},{"name":"d3viant0ne","email":"wiens.joshua@gmail.com"},{"name":"kevlened","email":"boyettel@gmail.com"},{"name":"michael-ciniawsky","email":"michael.ciniawsky@gmail.com"}],"time":{"modified":"2018-01-04T21:01:04.608Z","created":"2015-10-27T02:33:59.354Z","0.1.0":"2015-10-27T02:33:59.354Z","0.2.0":"2015-10-29T02:52:15.343Z","0.3.0":"2015-11-27T20:31:34.174Z","0.3.1":"2015-11-27T20:36:09.886Z","0.3.2":"2015-11-28T01:41:53.949Z","0.3.3":"2015-11-28T01:51:49.809Z","1.0.0":"2016-01-24T21:29:45.189Z","1.1.0":"2016-01-26T06:32:57.890Z","1.1.1":"2016-01-26T06:42:24.598Z","2.0.0":"2016-04-15T04:00:46.595Z","2.0.1":"2016-04-15T05:24:20.521Z","2.1.0":"2016-04-16T20:27:04.617Z","2.1.1":"2016-04-16T21:14:18.700Z","2.1.2":"2016-04-23T19:32:51.501Z","2.1.3":"2016-04-23T19:36:06.973Z","2.1.4":"2016-05-13T06:37:24.860Z","2.1.5":"2016-05-13T15:39:29.029Z","2.1.6":"2016-05-14T18:55:35.086Z","3.0.0":"2016-05-15T00:29:14.473Z","3.0.1":"2016-05-30T05:01:24.311Z","4.0.0":"2016-10-23T19:51:07.449Z","4.0.1":"2016-11-14T01:10:38.712Z","4.1.0":"2017-09-29T18:22:17.172Z","4.1.1":"2017-10-05T19:27:47.834Z","4.2.0":"2017-10-19T22:35:42.817Z","4.2.1":"2017-11-17T14:18:38.496Z","4.2.2":"2017-11-23T09:35:43.402Z","4.2.3":"2017-11-23T10:08:56.615Z","4.3.0":"2017-12-14T09:18:37.664Z","4.3.1":"2017-12-22T12:29:53.460Z"},"homepage":"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin","keywords":["webpack","plugin","transfer","move","copy"],"repository":{"type":"git","url":"git+https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin.git"},"author":{"name":"Len Boyette"},"bugs":{"url":"https://github.com/webpack-contrib/copy-webpack-plugin/issues"},"license":"MIT","readmeFilename":"README.md","users":{"corintho":true,"r3nya":true,"rbartoli":true,"zoey1990":true,"j3manoto":true,"igsys":true,"zwxajh":true,"antanst":true,"huangxinxin":true,"sdt":true,"fadihania":true,"ghostcode521":true,"chrisz-b612":true,"gusgarcia":true,"monolithed":true,"aristov":true,"langri-sha":true,"klimnikita":true,"shanewholloway":true,"manny":true,"yedaodao":true,"dheerajvs":true,"shakakira":true,"dbuggerx":true,"podlebar":true,"uptonking":true,"serge-nikitin":true,"monkeykode":true,"creager":true,"abuelwafa":true,"yayayahei":true,"andrej-k":true,"zhangchenna":true,"gurunate":true,"akh-rman":true,"tardis103":true,"shentengtu":true,"yeming":true,"fakefarm":true,"dngrmice":true,"abelykh":true,"ayoola_moore":true,"nisimjoseph":true,"mskjp":true,"raycharles":true,"jiaosl":true,"lore-w":true,"citguy":true},"_attachments":{},"_etag":"\"5a4e9610-e587\"","_lastModified":"Thu, 4 Jan 2018 21:01:04 GMT"}
